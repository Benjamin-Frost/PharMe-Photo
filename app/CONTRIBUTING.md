## Local Setup

- Install [<img src="https://flutter.dev/assets/images/shared/brand/flutter/icon/64.png" width="16" height="16"> Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Open a terminal in VSCode in the `app` directory
  - Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

You should now be able to run the app by opening the debug panel on the left and pressing the green triangle at the top (or using the shortcut <kbd>F5</kbd>).
