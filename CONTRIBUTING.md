# Contributing

Every project (i.e., subdirectories) also contain additional contribution information.

## Local setup

- Install [<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/favicon.ico" width="16" height="16"> Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/BP-Boettinger-21-22/frasecys.git` in your terminal
- Open the workspace `./frasecys.code-workspace` in VSCode
  - You'll probably see notifications asking you to install some extensions and get packages. Please confirm these two actions

## Selecting an issue

Visit the [issues page](https://github.com/BP-Boettinger-21-22/frasecys/issues) and look for an interesting problem you want to solve.

Once you have selected an issue to work on, assign yourself to that issue so we don't end up with two people doing the same thing.

## Working on stuff

To avoid conflicts with other contributors, create a new branch and switch to that branch. You could name your branch according to this pattern: `issue/<id>-<lowercase-issue-title-with-dashes>` (e.g., `issue/3-contribution-guide`).

Work on your code. Repeat:

- Implement your changes
- Commit your changes
- Push to the repo

## It's working!

When you're done, file a pull request. We will take a look at your code and once all checks pass, your code can get merged ðŸ¥³
